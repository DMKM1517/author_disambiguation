As mentioned previously in subsection \ref{subsec:3_process_flow}, for every pair of authors compared, a set of features is calculated. In table \ref{table:3_features} features chosen for the current work can be appreciated. \\

\begin{table} [h!] 
    \centering
    \begin{tabular} {|c|c|}
        \hline
        Feature Name & Calculation Description \\
        \hline
        First Name Initial & Equality in first name initial. \\
        Second Name Initial & Equality in middle name initial. \\
        Topic & Equality in LDA-determined topic  \\
        Publication Year Difference & Absolute difference between the publication years.  \\
        Keywords Distance & Jaccard distance between the keywords.  \\
        References Distance & Jaccard distance between the references.  \\
        Subject Distance & Jaccard distance between the subjects.  \\
        Tittle Distance & Jaccard distance between the tittles.  \\
        Coauthors Distance & Jaccard distance between the coauthors.  \\
        Ethnicity/Race & ???  \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Features calculated for every pair of authors}
    \label{table:3_features}
\end{table}

Considering the complexity of the calculation of some features, a more in depth description can be found.\\
